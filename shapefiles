# Credit to Robin Lovelace for his wonderful guide to creating maps using shapefiiles in R
# His github can be found at github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R for latest version

# Add relevant libraries
library(rgdal)
library(dplyr)
library(tmap)

# Using readOGR, invoke the shapefile folder and call it ldn
# This creates a Large Spatial Polygons Data Frame
# When you download the shapefile folder, you'll see that it contains several files 
# sharing the same name but ending in suffixes such as .shp, .prj, .sbn, .sbx etc...
# Make sure you specify the file name with "layer = "

ldn <- readOGR(dsn = "C:\\...", layer = "London_Borough_Excluding_MHW")

# Make a quick plot of the boundary lines to check that it works
plot(ldn)

# Add your own data
data<- read.csv("C:\\...")

# Merge your data with the shapefiles using "left_join" from the dply library
# left_join will add your data to the left of the ldn variable
# You must have a column in your data with the boundary names matching 'NAME' in the shapefile 
# in this example, 'NAME' = 'borough'

ldn@data <- left_join(ldn@data, data, by = c('NAME' = 'borough'))

# Make a quick choropleth map with the qtm function from tmap, referencing a column (c) in your data
# in this example, tot_off represents the total number of criminal offences in FY2015
# fill.palette allows you to select your colour scheme

qtm(ldn, fill = c("tot_off"), fill.palette = "-Oranges")

# You can add more than one column at a time in order to make multiple choropleth maps quickly
qtm(ldn, fill = c("tot_off", "tot_violence", "tot_burglary", "tot_robbery"), fill.palette = "-Oranges")
